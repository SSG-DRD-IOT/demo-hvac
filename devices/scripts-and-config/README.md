#Configuration Files (JSON)

These are example JSON files that configure edge devices being used with the demo.

* **example-gateway.json** - Example configuration file for gateways.  Tells the edison which host name to look for.
* **example-config.json** - Example sensor configuration file.  As long as your sensor has been used with the industrial demo system before, this is all you need to edit to integrate your sensor into the system speedily.
* **example-announcement.json** - Mainly for developer use.  This file shows what sort of announcement we attempt to send to the gateway upon finding it.

The other files are example configuration files for existing sensors used in demonstrations of the industrial demo.
